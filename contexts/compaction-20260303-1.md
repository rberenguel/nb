# Session Compaction Summary

## User Intent
- Improve mobile UX of the Training Calendar modal (sizing, typography, gestures)
- Add streak tracking to the calendar view
- Minor performance and polish improvements across the app

## Contextual Work Summary

### Calendar Modal — Layout Fixes
- Modal width was content-driven, causing it to be narrow when a month had no session data and wider when cells had badges; fixed by setting `width: 95%` explicitly on `#modal-history`
- Height was variable (4/5/6 week months looked different); fixed by setting `height: 90%` on both `#modal-history` and `#modal-pause` so they are always consistent
- `#modal-history` made `display: flex; flex-direction: column` so `#history-list` can use `flex: 1` to fill remaining space; removed the old `max-height: 60vh` limit on the list

### Calendar Modal — Mobile Typography
- Added `@media (max-width: 767px)` block: reduced modal padding from `2rem` to `1rem`, `h2` to `1.1rem`, calendar header `h3` to `0.9rem`, calendar grid gap and day padding tightened
- Modal base sizes changed from `max-width: 90% / max-height: 80%` to `max-width: 95% / max-height: 95%`
- Added `overflow-x: hidden` to `.modal-content` to prevent horizontal scrollbars

### Streak Tracking
- `computeStreak(sessions)` added to `modals.js`: counts consecutive days with sessions backwards from today; starts from yesterday if today has no sessions yet (avoids "0 streak" feeling on a fresh morning)
- Streak line rendered in `renderCalendar()` between the month header and the grid, using the Phosphor lightning icon (`\ue2de`); hidden when streak is 0
- CSS classes `.calendar-streak` and `.streak-icon` added

### Calendar Swipe Gestures
- Touch swipe handlers attached once at module load time to `#history-list`; left swipe = next month, right swipe = prev month
- Requires horizontal dominance (abs dx > 50px and > 1.5× abs dy) to avoid conflicting with vertical scroll

### Fire System Performance
- `fire.js` loop now bails early (skipping all canvas work) when `progress === 0` and no particles are alive; RAF still re-queues itself so it wakes when fire starts

### Version Bump
- `manifest.json` and `sw.js` bumped from `0.7.0` to `0.7.1`

## Files Touched

### Core Modules
- **modals.js**: Added `computeStreak()`, streak HTML in `renderCalendar()`, swipe gesture handlers at module init level
- **fire.js**: Early-return guard in `loop()` when idle

### Styles
- **style.css**: Modal size defaults (95%/95%), `overflow-x: hidden`; mobile media query for padding/typography; `.calendar-streak` / `.streak-icon` styles; fixed-height rules for `#modal-history` and `#modal-pause`; `width: 95%` on `#modal-history`

### PWA
- **manifest.json**: Version 0.7.1
- **sw.js**: Cache name updated to `nb-cache-v0.7.1`
