A very simple PWA for the [n-back task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-back), visual-only.

A long time ago I found an app I liked for it, with only positions and letters. Most are position+audio, which I don't like. But that stopped working, soâ€¦ [Wrote my own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubPWaDWcOLU).

I have the feeling the n-back task is useful for focus. Otherwise, it was a neat side project to hack together in a couple afternoons.
